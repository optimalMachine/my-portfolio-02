                Hello. My name is Jiuk who is a Blockchain Developer & Front End Developer based in Dallas, Texas. Aside from my 
                role as a developer, I love to do research about financial markets to find alpha(s) (trading opportunities / profits). If you are curious about me,
                please contact me anytime you want.
            </p>
